## Overview

### Shell

- **alacritty**:  
  Alacritty is used as the default terminal emulator with a config included here

- **zsh**:  
  zsh is used as the main shell with a couple of "plugins" to make it
  nicer to use. Plugins include syntax highlighting and autosuggestions.

- **zellij**:  
  zellij is used as the terminal multiplexer to allow multiple panes and tabs in the 
  same terminal window.

- **starship**:  
  starship is used as the shell prompt to make it look nice and display a lot of
  useful information at the prompt.

- **atuin**:  
  atuin is used for a more advanced shell history allowing fuzzy searching

- **shellmark**:  
  shellmark is used to allow bookmarking directories so that you can quickly 
  navigate to them. Add a directory by using `s add -n <name> <dir>` and then type `s` to open a fuzzy search to navigate
  to one of the bookmarks.
